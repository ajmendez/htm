  DESCRIPTION
 
  This example code just builds the index using exception handling
  and times its initialization.
 
  It can be invoked by
 
  	timeHTM level savelevel
 

  where

     level     : the level depth to build the index (2 - 14)
     savelevel : the level depth to keep index in memory ( <= level)

*******************************************************/

main(int argc,char ** argv) {

  	// initialize
	if(argc < 3) {
	  std::cout << "Usage: timeHTM level savelevel" << std::endl;
	  return -1;
	}
	try {
	  // build the index and time it
	  time_t t0 = clock();
	  SpatialIndex index(atoi(argv[1]),atoi(argv[2]));
	  time_t t1 = clock();
	  printf(" Time to build index: %f sec\n",
		 (double) (t1-t0) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
	}
	catch (SpatialException x)
	  {
	  }

	return 0;
}
